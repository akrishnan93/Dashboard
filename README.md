# Dashboard
CS 4261 First Programming Assignment -- React Native Application

A dashboard application that is meant to give all the information a user would need to have a successful day in one place. For example, users would be able to get an understanding of the weather, their calendar events for the day, emails, news, and other items all in one dynamically-synced application. So far, I have built the weather part of this application. I am using firebase for authentication and OpenWeatherMap rest API calls to get access to data dynamically based on the userâ€™s location for the application. 

The user is able to login to the dashboard and get detailed weather information with regards to their location. The reason I chose to build this application is because I would love to use an app like this for a quick briefing of my day all in one place quickly, effortlessly, and efficiently. In addition, creating a project like this is the perfect way to get a solid understanding of the fundamentals of a new framework/language: API calls, basic input features, authentication, and more.
